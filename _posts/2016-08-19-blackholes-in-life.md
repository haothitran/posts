Today, you can open a door and find thousands, or even millions, of people on the other side who are all interested in something you have never heard about in your entire life.

Even more fascinating is that these people can have a whole way of experiencing life that you have no concept of hoping ever to understand. New ideas and vocabulary that would be unfamiliar to a general audience.  If you were in the same room as them, it would be as if they were speaking a foreign language to each other with a few interspersed words you recognize.

It sounds ridiculous, but it's true.

It is remarkable how people can develop such varied relationships based on what they know, what they are interested in, and how willing they are to learn something new and different. It's what makes people unique. And what makes life interesting. 

There is always something new to discover and learn.
