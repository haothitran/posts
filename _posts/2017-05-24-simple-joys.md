# Simple Joys

- Removing labels from products.
- Ripping perforated paper.
- Running into an old friend in the wild who you haven't seen in a long time.
- Discovering a new favourite song.
- Finishing what you started a while ago.
- Laying on fresh bedsheets straight out of the dryer.
- Afternoon naps in sunbeams.
- Great stories.
- Hearing the gap of the rain's pitter patter as you go through an underpass of a bridge.
- Finding money you forgot you stashed away.
- Suddenly understanding a new concept or idea you have been struggling with for a while. It is like a whole new world opens up.
- Beating a personal record in something—even better when it is for something trivial—because why not?
- Coming home after a long day.
- Getting a good night's sleep.
- A nice cup of tea. Or coffee.
