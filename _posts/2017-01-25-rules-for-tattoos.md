title: Rules for Tattoos

I have developed a set of personal rules when I am considering getting a tattoo.

I think that finding a talented artist and a reputable tattoo shop are sensible considerations that hopefully speak for themselves. Not to mention keeping in mind that tattoos are basically going to last forever. Thus, spending time researching or musing over a potential idea for a few months isn't much time in the grand scheme of things.

As such, the following rules specifically deal with the art itself:

- No names.
- No faces.
- Avoid text of any kind.
- Avoid straight lines and geometric shapes.
- Don't be fully committed to a design or location before speaking to an artist.

## Issues with Text and Lines

Text and lines need structure and negative space to look good. For text, most fonts are designed for print or screen use where reading surfaces are flat and have strict boundaries. Our bodies have neither of these qualities. Skin stretches unevenly over muscle and bone, and every body part flows seamlessly into another. Over time, our bodies change and will warp the flow of any tattoo comprising of text or straight lines.

Don't get me wrong—certain styles can have text and lines that look timeless when designed well and proportionally for the body.

Another issue with text is the meaning of the words themselves. Language is always being socially constructed; the meaning of a word or phrase may change in different contexts and situations. Even your connection to certain quotes and lyrics can evolve over time. As such, it can become difficult to personally identify with some of your current favourite words or phrases as you grow older and learn more about yourself, or for others to interpret them the way you intended.

If a piece of text resonated strongly with me, and I was adamant about having it inked, I would try to create an image representation of it. Then get the image representation inked instead. This is for future-proofing the tattoo. It is easier to later alter the meaning of an image than the meaning of a word or phrase. Besides, people always say that an image is worth a thousand words, right? So it is technically more cost efficient to always get an image inked compared to text.

## Don't Early Commit

Currently, I have two tattoos; both of which I had a sketch for when I went to get inked. In both instances, I knew what I wanted, knew where I wanted it, and had a clear picture of what it was going to look like. However, the journey from design to ink were both different experiences.

The first one was inked exactly the way I designed it. It is great. No complaints.

However, the second was a different experience altogether. I walked into the tattoo shop with my design and my artist told me that what I had drawn up would not translate well to skin. He explained why particular details of the design would be lost in transition from one medium to the other—in other words, from paper to skin. He also made suggestions that I didn't think about when I was designing my tattoo, such as changing the location of where I wanted the piece so that my body would frame it better. Taking his reasoning, I decided to have him adjust the design to his professional judgement.

We discussed what needed to be changed and he went to go draw up the adjustments. I agreed to the first design he came back with. In the end, I had the idea of what I wanted, but the overall look and placement completely changed. And I absolutely love it.

It is important to remember that tattoo artists are professionals in their craft. They know what works and what doesn't, what will look good on skin and what won't. I'll always be willing to hear out their opinions and consider their advice before fully committing to a design.
