title: Rules for Tattoos
date: 2017-01-25

I have developed a set of personal rules when considering getting a tattoo.

- Talented artist and reputable tatto shop—need I say more?
- No names—does this even need an explanation?
- No faces—portraits are more likely going to turn out... not great.
- Avoid text of any kind.
- Avoid straight lines and geometric shapes.
- Don't be fully committed to a design or location before speaking to an artist.

## Issues with Text and Lines

Text and lines need structure and negative space to look good. Our bodies have neither of these qualities. Skin stretches unevenly over muscle and bone, and every part flows seamlessly into another. Over time, our bodies change and will warp the flow of any tattoo comprising of text or straight lines.

Don't get me wrong—certain styles can have text and lines that look timeless when designed well and proportionally for the body. These are exceptions.

Another issue with text is the meaning of the words themselves. Language is socially constructed; the meaning of a word or phrase may change in different contexts and situations. As such, it can become difficult to personally identify with some of your current favourite quotes or phrases in the future or for others to interpret them the way you intended. Anyone can misconstrue text.

If a piece of text resonated strongly with me, and I was adamant about having it inked, I would try to create an image representation of it and get that inked. It is easier to alter an image's meaning later than a word or phrase. Besides, people always say that a picture is worth a thousand words, right? So it is technically more cost-efficient to get an image inked rather than a string of text.

## Don't Early Commit

It is important to remember that tattoo artists are professionals in their craft. They know what works and what doesn't. They know what will translate well from paper to skin and where a design should be placed so that your body would frame a piece better. I'll always be willing to hear their opinions and consider their advice before fully committing to a design.
