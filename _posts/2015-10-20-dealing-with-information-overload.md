title: Dealing with Information Overload
date: 2015-10-20

There is too much noise and not enough signal in our modern digital culture. We are constantly being bombarded by information from various sources. All of them demand our attention and calling out, "Look at me! Look here! This is important! Look!" It has become challenging to distinguish the importance of things. 

When everything is important, nothing is important.

I don't believe that the best way to deal with this constant stream of information is to switch off your devices and disconnect from the Internet. Because eventually, your self-imposed break will be over, and you'll be back to square one. Actually, probably even worse because you'll want to catch up on what you missed while you were in Internet exile.

Every stream of information is another bar for your attention prison. You need to cut some bars or shorten them, so it is easier to get out when you need to. Have an escape.

I don't think it is possible to disconnect indefinitely eitherâ€”and if it is, it would be tough. Our modern digital culture demands us to be connected in some shape or form. We need emails to apply to jobs, log onto services, and communicate with others. Forever tethered in some shape or form.

We need to stop trying to take in so much information. We need to stop giving too much information. We need to be selective of where we spend our time and attention. Lessen the possibility of distractions.

Social media is a black hole that seems to grow exponentially by the second, and the fractional amount of what you know will always be a drop in the ocean. There is no way to keep up or keep out. So we need to learn to aggressively filter or ignore it. Trim back your friends' list to those you actually care about, remove groups you're not participating in, turn off notifications you can't do anything about. You don't need to know about everything that is going on.

You can enjoy a peaceful day without the rest of the world.
