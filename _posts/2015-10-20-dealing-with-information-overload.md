# Dealing with Information Overload

There is too much noise and not enough signal in our modern digital culture. We are constantly being bombarded by information from various sources. All of them demand our attention and calling out, “Look at me! Look here! This is important! Look!” It has become very difficult to distinguish the actual importance of things.

I don’t believe that the best way to deal with this constant stream of information is to switch off your devices and disconnect from the Internet. Because eventually your self-imposed break will be over and you’ll be back. And you will be facing the same problem again. Most likely facing the same problem at an even larger scale if you want to try to catch back up on what you missed while you were gone.

Every stream of information is another bar for your attention prison. You need to purposefully cut some bars or shorten them so that it is easier to get out when you need to. Have an escape.

However, I don’t think it is possible to disconnect indefinitely either—and if it is it would be extremely difficult. Our modern digital culture demands us to be connected in some shape or form. We need emails to apply to jobs, log into services, and communicate with others. Our phones have become our personal portable connection to the Internet, and also acts as a harvesting machine of our habits for online advertising agencies and social media networks. Forever tethered in some way, shape, and form.

We need to stop trying to take in so much information. We need to stop giving too much information. We need to be selective of where we spend our time and attention. It isn’t easy to sip from a firehose, but it is possible.

It is not really an issue of being on many social networks either, but rather spending too much time on them without purpose. Trim back your friends list to those you actually care about, remove groups you’re not actively participating in, turn off notifications that you can’t do anything about. Lessen the possibility of distractions that can rip your attention away from what you’re doing or should be doing. You don’t need to know about everything that is going on.

Social media is a black hole that seems to grow exponentially by the second, and the fractional amount of what you know will always be a drop in the ocean.

You don’t have to delete all your social media accounts. Just aggressively filter what information you do receive so you have less to deal with when the next batch comes in. And if you choose to do so, you don’t have to go through it all at once. Or at all.
