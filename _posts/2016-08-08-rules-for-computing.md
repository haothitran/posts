## General

- Keep work and play separate.

## Software

- Use as little software as possible.
  - Sometimes, multiple individual tools do things better than a general jack-of-all-trades tool that does many things poorly.
- Pick the process that will cause the least amount of frustration.
- Pay for software that is worth paying for.
- Remove all traces of software that you no longer use.

## Hardware

- Always prioritize ergonomics in your setup.
  - Choose comfort over aesthetics.
  - Take breaks.
- Use as few machines as possible.
- Do not use your phone for tasks that would be more comfortably and effectively accomplished on a computer.

## Data

- Keep as much as possible in simple and/or open standard formats. 
- Name dated files in `YYYY-MM-DD_title` format.
- Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule.
  1. Keep at least 3 copies of your data.
  2. Store 2 copies on different storage media.
  3. Have 1 copy located offsite.
- Runaway from service providers that make it difficult to export your data.
