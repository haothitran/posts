# Rules for Computing

## General

- Keep work and play separate.

## Software

- Use as little software as possible.
  - Make every piece of software justify being on your machine and in your processes.
  - Sometimes multiple individual tools do things better than a general tool that does many things poorly. Pick the process that will cause the least amount of frustration.
- Pay for software that is worth paying for, but only after evaluating them for a while or having incorporated them into your workflow.
- Remove all traces of software that you no longer use.

## Hardware

- Always prioritize ergonomics in your setup.
  - Always choose comfort over aesthetics.
  - Take breaks.
- Use as few physical machines as possible.
- Do not use your phone for tasks that would be more comfortably and effectively accomplished on a computer.

## Data

- Keep as much as possible in simple and/or open standard formats. For example, keep notes in plain text instead of a proprietary format for a word processor.
- Always name dated files in `YYYY-MM-DD_title` format.
- Have at least three backup copies of files, with at least one offsite.
- Run away from service providers that make it difficult to export your data.
