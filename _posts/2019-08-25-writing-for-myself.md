I like this space. It is my own small personal place on the web where I can write about anything and everything. I like having somewhere to write things out so that I can sort of burn those thoughts away from my brain, but can refer back to if necessary. I don't know how to explain it. Just know that it is therapeutic for me.

However, I've fallen off the wagon lately with regards to writing for myself.

There have been so many things going on in my life that I haven't had time to sit down and really think about how I feel and how I want to move forward. Connecting the dots between my stray thoughts. Sometimes I find it frustrating that I have so many thoughts and ideas, but I can't find the right words to string together in a way that makes sense out loud. Usually I write for myself to make sense of it all.

I need to pick up the pen again.
