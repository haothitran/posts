When I was a kid, I wanted to collect anything and everything. It never got to the point where I was carefully stepping over stuff in my childhood bedroom, but my shelves were full of random collectibles and knickknacks.  In hindsight, this might explain why I hated dusting as a chore.

Recently, I moved to a new address and took the moving opportunity to audit my thingsâ€”one item at a time. It was more time-consuming than I expected, and I don't want to go through that again for future moves.

Thankfully, I didn't have a difficult time purging things. Although I felt a sense of nostalgia going through old keepsakes and souvenirs, I mostly felt a sense of relief getting rid of them. I know that some people have a rough time with this process when decluttering. For myself, I took a picture of some items before getting rid of them, and I think that was sufficient as a keepsake for me.

I don't want my life to be full of stuff. I want my life to be full of remarkable experiences and happy memories.
