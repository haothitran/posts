# Developing the Dash Journal System

It is undeniable that the stationery market is oversaturated with options. There are thousands of planning templates and systems out there that promise to organize your life. There is even an endless sea of digital productivity apps and services constantly being churned out which promise the same. Yet, trying to find one that works for you seems like an impossibility.

I'm the type of person that needs to break down large projects into smaller, manageable, actionable tasks. However, if I don't schedule these small tasks, then they become just another item on my wish list to get done. This is a problem. I lose track of where I am in projects. I forget to do certain tasks. I waste time backtracking my steps. I am less productive.

I needed a system to help keep me on track.

## Identifying Needs

I realized that mindlessly jumping from different tools and platforms was not a productive use of my time. As such, I made a list of requirements:

- Record short bursts of information.
- Task tracking which are usually part of larger projects.
- Be able to assign priority to tasks.
- Be able to update changing status of tasks.
- Constant access for ubiquitous capture.
- Require little to no setup.

Immediate strike out if something I'm trying out does not fulfil any of these requirements. No time to dilly dally.

## Search

I had hoped that my requirements would drastically filter out available options, but I was wrong. It was like I was facing an immortal army of productivity solutions.

Each one that passed my requirements test was exercised extensively for my personal use case to see how well they held up to the job. Ideally, the best one would be the least disruptive to use. I want it to integrate seamlessly into my existing processes while providing more structure and organization to the overall system.

Unfortunately, to integrate any one of them into my flow caused a lot of friction. Usually it was because a simple function was made overly complicated to reach by a clunky user interface. It was a trend I noticed in many of the tools and services I tried. Many of them advertise being easy and simple to use, but in reality they sacrifice usability for a cleaner look. This is frustrating to say the least.

Also, my search is hindered by the fact that I dislike having extraneous features on my tools. What's the point of having them there when I'm never going to use them? Never mind the fact I can ignore their existence. Of course, this preference of mine made my search even more difficult.

## Develop

Eventually I started to think about developing (expanding?) my own system. Why lock myself into someone else's productivity system when I can make my own and tailor it to my particular needs and preference? It didn't make sense to change the way I recorded my tasks and notes to fit them into arbitrary layouts and spaces that someone else created. In designing my own productivity system, I'll know that it will definitely work for me.

Following my requirements test, I made another list of requirements and specifications for developing my productivity system:

- Does not rely on a power source to use.
  - Automatically, this forced me to develop an analogue solution.
  - However, must easily be converted to a digital system if necessary.
- Use simple symbols.
- No index. Too much maintenance.
- Chronological event logging.
- Accessible reference lists.

Although I can see how maintaining an index would be useful, I think it is far too much work to keep up with. I have never needed to reference back to an old task list, so migrating information back and forth is too much work for little gain for me. Maybe I'll revisit this idea if I ever work on a large project that spans over a long period of time, such as a home renovation project. However, in that case, it would make more sense to use a separate notebook for special projects.

## Result

In keeping with its name, my dash journal system is built on using dashes (`-`) in a list-style format in a commonplace notebook. Here is the legend that I use:

```
# title
# YYYYMMDD dated entry title
- note
- task item
+ completed task item
-> task carried forward
<- task postponed or delegated
* important
```

I have some pieces of information that I want to reference regularly kept at the back of my notebook. Lists of books to consider reading, movies to watch, drinks I have tried out, and other various tracking lists. Having these lists easily accessible at the back means that I don't have to deal with maintaining pesky page numbers for an index list.

I've been using this system for months now and it has served me well. In the future, I might need to change or add more functions, but I believe that this system leaves more than enough room for expansion and adjustment when the time comes.
