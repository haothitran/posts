# Open Format Standardization in Education

I have a problem with higher level education.

Universities and colleges purport being bastions of knowledge who generously impart upon their students valuable information, skills, and credentials—only for a small fee called tuition, of course. However, there is a discrepancy in what they preach and their operations. Namely, why don't schools standardize using open file formats for their materials?

Disregarding the fact that textbooks are absurdly expensive, I believe that non-lecture materials should not be handed out in proprietary formats as it poses significant problems for students. It forces students into a vulnerable position where they are dependent on proprietary software to access their educational materials: course outlines, slides, presentations, and various other file types. They should never be put into this type of situation, especially by the educational institution itself.

In the worst use case scenario, information embedded in these files can only be read using certain versions of proprietary software. This is prohibitively expensive for students if the cost is on them to personally pay to have access, or even maintain access. They also risk the chance of the software becoming obsolete and abandoned—planned obsolescence anyone? I understand that research and innovation are pushing new ideas, concepts, and boundaries all the time, but is it really necessary for fundamental student tools to learn about these new and exciting things to change?

Although some proprietary formats can be read by open-source alternatives, less tech-savvy students might not be aware of this fact. Not to mention the possibility of running into issues of incompatibility, errors, and data corruption when going this route. Using open-source shouldn't have to require students to jump through hoops. Files in open-source formats ensures that future access to read and understand them is ensured—sometimes even by a wider variety of software options for years later—at a fraction of the price of proprietary software.

Students should never have to worry about paying to access and view their learning materials. Yet, they can't even really do anything about this situation because the higher education system itself forces students into using proprietary software—including satellite third-parties with vested interests in educational profits. The entire system has to change.
