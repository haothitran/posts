Life gets busy sometimes. However, I think that a lot of people are under the illusion that they are busy because they are overwhelmed.

We live in a modern world where we have privileges and freedoms that we never had before. Our quality of life has greatly increased. However, those things come at a cost because every choice requires a decision to be made, and every decision requires our focus. Focus is not something we have in abundance anymore.

We have so many opportunities and options available to us, and we always need to make a decision about what to act on or what not to act on. All these little decisions add up. Inevitably, decision fatigue sets in and we start to avoid making those decisions. Rather than deal with things, we keep jamming them into the back of our mental pantry until there is no more room causing us to make quick, uninformed choices we would've otherwise not have made.

We need mental room to reflect. Space to breathe. Set limits because if we don't set boundaries for ourselves, others will set them for usâ€”and we may not like where they draw the line. We can't burden ourselves with unnecessary responsibilities and choices. We can't do everything.
