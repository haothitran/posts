Five in the morning. Near-zero visibility. Only lights passed through the dense fog blanketing the streets. I had to drive slowly and cautiously, watching lights fade in and out around me. Red light, green light. Crazy weather.

Quiet times like this make me think that I could be a morning person. There is something enticing about being awake while the world around you is still asleep. Feeling like there are endless possibilities for the day ahead of you. I don’t know how to explain it.

At least it wasn’t too cold for December.

Until next time.
