A few weeks ago, I came across a markup language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is a lightweight syntax used on plain text to indicate various common formatting elements when it is rendered.

Although I like the idea of taking all my notes in plain text, I need to structure my notes better. It is difficult to scan and read a wall of text. Need to throw in some headings, emphasis, and dividers to break it up. I'd attempted to create my own syntax, but that was a miserable failure. Just couldn't commit to any of my ideas. Discovering Markdown couldn't have come at a better time.

Markdown still has many of the same limitations as plain text. However, it provides a way to create simple tables, which is a *huge* plus for me. Here is an example of a table using Markdown syntax:

```
| Level | Talent 1          |      Talent 2      |          Talent 3 |
|-------|:------------------|:------------------:|------------------:|
| 56    | Rolling Blood     |    Plague Leech    |     Unholy Blight |
| 57    | Lichborne         |  Anti-Magic Zone   |         Purgatory |
| 58    | Death's Advance   |    Chillblains     |        Asphyxiate |
| 60    | Death Pact        |    Death Siphon    |        Conversion |
| 75    | Blood Tap         | Runic Empowerment  |  Runic Corruption |
| 90    | Gorefiend's Grasp | Remorseless Winter | Desecrated Ground |
```

And it will output a table like this:

| Level | Talent 1          |      Talent 2      |          Talent 3 |
|-------|:------------------|:------------------:|------------------:|
| 56    | Rolling Blood     |    Plague Leech    |     Unholy Blight |
| 57    | Lichborne         |  Anti-Magic Zone   |         Purgatory |
| 58    | Death's Advance   |    Chillblains     |        Asphyxiate |
| 60    | Death Pact        |    Death Siphon    |        Conversion |
| 75    | Blood Tap         | Runic Empowerment  |  Runic Corruption |
| 90    | Gorefiend's Grasp | Remorseless Winter | Desecrated Ground |

Thankfully, it was easy to incorporate Markdown into my existing workflow. I can still focus on my work rather than on formatting or any other distractions with a word processor. There is just a bit of markup I have to add alongside my writing, which is unobtrusive even when the file is unrendered.

Plain text is beautiful, but Markdown makes it even better. A valuable addition to my digital toolbox.
