A few weeks ago, I came across this lightweight markup language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is a syntax used on plain text to indicate various kinds of formatting you want to apply when it is converted into another format.

I like that you can signify formatting for plain text without leaving the keyboard. It has a small learning curve; you only need to learn where to put asterisks (`*`), dashes (`-`), backticks (`` ` ``), and pound signs (`#`) to format text. For example, you use `*single asterisks*` surrounding text to *emphasize* it. Keeps notes simple to write and easy to read.

Markdown still has many of the same limitations as plain text. However, it provides a way to create simple tables. Here is an example of a table using Markdown syntax:

```
| Level | Talent 1          | Talent 2           | Talent 3          |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 56    | Rolling Blood     | Plague Leech       | Unholy Blight     |
| 57    | Lichborne         | Anti-Magic Zone    | Purgatory         |
| 58    | Death's Advance   | Chillblains        | Asphyxiate        |
| 60    | Death Pact        | Death Siphon       | Conversion        |
| 75    | Blood Tap         | Runic Empowerment  | Runic Corruption  |
| 90    | Gorefiend's Grasp | Remorseless Winter | Desecrated Ground |
```

And it will output a table like this:

| Level | Talent 1          | Talent 2           | Talent 3          |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 56    | Rolling Blood     | Plague Leech       | Unholy Blight     |
| 57    | Lichborne         | Anti-Magic Zone    | Purgatory         |
| 58    | Death's Advance   | Chillblains        | Asphyxiate        |
| 60    | Death Pact        | Death Siphon       | Conversion        |
| 75    | Blood Tap         | Runic Empowerment  | Runic Corruption  |
| 90    | Gorefiend's Grasp | Remorseless Winter | Desecrated Ground |

For the past few months, I've been using plain text notes. However, I've been looking for a way to logically break up my notes in sectionsâ€”it is difficult to read walls of text. I'd attempted to create my own syntax to structure my content, but could never fully commit to a method. Discovering Markdown couldn't have come at a better time for me.

It was easy to incorporate Markdown into my existing workflow. I can still completely focus on my content rather than on formatting tools because I am still technically working in plain text. It just has a little bit of markup added to it.
