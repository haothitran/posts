Over the last year, I've rediscovered the vast world of podcasts and how well they fit into my lifestyle. Smartphones and podcast apps have made it easier to subscribe, download, and keep up with shows. 

I've become quite an avid listener because of my commute to and from school. Some shows I listen to are of the educational variety, which is funny because that means I basically spend my entire day out learning something new. Other shows are just for the pure entertainment value.

On that note, here are some podcasts that I listen to:

- [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/) by CGP Grey and Dr. Brady Haran.
- [Cortext](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) hosted by CGP Grey and Myke Hurley.
- [Lore](http://www.lorepodcast.com/) by Aaron Mahnke.
- [The Pen Addict](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict) hosted by Myke Hurley and Brad Dowdy.
- [Reconcilable Differences](https://www.relay.fm/rd) by John Siracusa and Merlin Mann.

Many activities only require the attention of my eyes and hands. My ears are free. I can listen to an episode or two when I am doing something mindless and repetitive, like everyday chores or grinding rifts in Diablo III. Podcasts fit well into these pockets of time.

It is an appealing form of entertainment for me. I enjoy being a silent participant in several different conversations relating to my personal interests. When show hosts go on tangents, I can tune it out for a moment or skip an entire conversation thread altogether. In extreme cases, I can just drop a podcast if the show's direction no longer interests me.

I admit that it took me a while to get back into listening to podcasts. I think they are difficult to get into by yourself because there are so many shows and niche topics. It is overwhelming and intimidating to dive into them alone without guidance. For myself, I found a topic that interested me and started listening from the first episode. From there, my podcast library grew organically into other shows.
