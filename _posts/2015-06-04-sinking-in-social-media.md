title: Sinking in Social Media

I've developed a habit of constantly checking social media. Unconsciously, I'd take out my phone or open a new browser tab on my computer and mindlessly scroll through social feeds I don't even care about. But when someone else does it, I can see how stupid it is to literally lose your life trying to keep up on how other people are living—or, rather, curating their pages. And I want to stop this.

Social media is a constant source of non-actionable distraction. Attention is pulled away from what you are working on towards something that probably doesn't even deserve it. There is nothing I can do when I receive a new notification. Most of the time, I can only say, "Oh, that's nice." That's it. Even worse is that even when I don't have a notification waiting for me, I still pick up my phone to see what I missed to get that instant rush of dopamine.

I can't be left alone to my own thoughts. I don't have room to be left alone to my own thoughts because these social feeds are taking up my mental space. And I want it back. Having a constant flow of information—most of which is irrelevant or useless to me—leaves no room to pause and think. There is no more space left.

I've already deleted my Facebook account. In my opinion, it is the most intrusive and greatest depressor of all social media networks. And I found it interesting that it makes you request for your account to be deleted, then deactivates your account for 14 days before it is actually deleted. If any time during those 14 days you log in, your account is fully restored. It is like leaving a poured drink in the same room as someone who just turned over a new leaf on their sobriety. Facebook makes it easy to get hooked back in when you are forced to leave one foot in the door.

Admittedly, I had to substitute the reflexive habit of pulling out my phone when I was waiting for something. At first, I played a simple puzzle game I installed specifically for this purpose. A mindless puzzle game that had no ads. I thought that this was a huge improvement over just scrolling through endless social feeds. Eventually, I learned how to just be idle and enjoy observing my surrounding environment.

It is time for me to start seriously thinking about what I want from social media and what kind of role I want it to have in my life. Most of the time it is not worth my attention—so why am I giving it the chance to distract me?
