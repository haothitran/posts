I've developed a habit of constantly checking social media. Unconsciously, I'd take out my phone or open a new browser tab on my computer and start scrolling through social feeds I don't care about. I don't even think about it. I just do it. But when someone else does it, I can see how stupid it is to spend your life trying to keep up on how other people live their lives—or, rather, curating their pages.

Social media is a constant source of non-actionable distraction. It destroys your focus. There is nothing I can do when I receive a new notification. Most of the time, I can only say, "Oh, that's nice." That's it. Even worse, when I don't have a notification waiting for me, I still pick up my phone to see what I missed.

Just can't get enough of that instant rush of dopamine.

I can't be alone with my own thoughts. I don't have room left to be alone with my own thoughts because these social feeds are taking up my mental space. And I want it back. Having a constant flow of information—most of which is irrelevant or useless to me—leaves no room to pause and think. There is no more space left.

I've already deleted my Facebook account. I think it is the most intrusive of all social media networks right now. And I found it interesting that it makes you request for your account to be deleted, then deactivates your account for 14 days. If you log in during those 14 days, it fully restores your account in good working order. It is like leaving a drink poured in the same room as someone who just turned over a new leaf on their sobriety. Facebook makes it easy to get hooked back in when they force you to leave one foot in the door.

Admittedly, I had to substitute the reflexive habit of pulling out my phone when I was waiting for something. At first, I played a simple puzzle game with no ads that I intentionally installed for this purpose. Eventually, I learned how to just be idle and enjoy observing my surroundings.

And you know what? There is a lot of beauty in everyday life.

It is time for me to start seriously thinking about what I want from social media. What is the role of social media in my life? Most of the time, it is not worth my attention—so why am I giving it the chance to distract me?
