It is nice to work on a project you are solely responsible for planning, designing, and executing. No other stakeholders are involvedâ€”I can do whatever I want whenever I want. Experiment with something new and extreme. Learn how to use different tools and methods. Keep things interesting to stimulate the brain and exercise my underused creativity muscles.

So, what is the purpose of this space?

I believe owning your online presence will be important in the future. Everyone is moving onto social media platforms, but how long will that last? No doubt there will be massive migrations between social media platforms as their popularity rises and falls. Are you moving your online presence each time that occurs? Are you signing up to every latest and greatest platform that pops up and starts trending? Eventually, you will have so many accounts it would be impossible to manage them all. That is not sustainable.

No. Just having this domain space is good enough for me.

I'm planning on writing blog posts here. Maybe showcase some web projects. Maybe show off some of my amateur photography. Who knows? I could use this space as a reckless playground for testing web development and design. I could post as frequently, or infrequently, as my muse hits me without worrying about keeping up with an arbitrary schedule. 

And that is *true* ownership.
