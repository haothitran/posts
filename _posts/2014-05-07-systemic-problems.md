Sometimes working harder is not the solution. 

Sometimes there is a systemic problem that needs to be addressed. Multiple interconnected issues may have caused it, or it may have originated from a source anchored deep within the system. 

In either case, something needs to change in the overall structure for things to improve. 

It is not always your fault. 

Sometimes things are out of your immediate control. 

And sometimes you can't do anything about it.
