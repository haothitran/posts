I've always thought that television shows or movies with inner voice narration were just a trope. But it is not! Some people actually "hear" an inner voice as their thoughts! And their thoughts are actual words!

That is wild.

For me, it is like I have a cloud of abstract non-word thoughts (intentions?) over my head. When I verbalize my thoughts, I have to consciously pull them out of nothingness and "translate" them into words for someone else to understand. It takes a lot of time and effort to make sense of what I'm thinking or feeling â€” even for myself.

Sometimes, I think about nothing. My mind is dark and quiet.

I wonder if it gets overwhelming for people who have an inner voice. Do they constantly "hear" a stream of conversation in their head all day? That would be exhausting for me. Also, it seems like an inefficient way to live? Do they have to "talk" to themselves about everything that they are doing? Is it like being in a meeting all day with yourself?

So many questions.
