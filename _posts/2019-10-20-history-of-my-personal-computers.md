A quick look at the history of my personal computers.

## First

First computer I can specifically remember using was my 13-inch Macbook Pro laptop running Mac OS X Snow Leopard (verson 10.6). Honestly, I don't even know why I scrounged up all of my birthday and holiday money to buy this laptop. Probably for dumb cool kid points from my peers at the time. It served as a glorified web surfing machine.

## 2010-12

Needed more power for games than what the Macbook Pro could provide. Specifically for Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Purchased a pre-built computer from Canada Computers at Pacific Mall.

CPU: Intel Core i5-2500 3.3GHz quad-core processor  
Motherboard: MSI H61M-P21 B3 LGA1155 micro-ATX motherboard  
Memory: Kingston 8GB DDR3-1333 (x2 for 16GB)  
Video card: EVGA GeForce GTX960 2GB video card  

Spent a lot of time messing around with different Linux distributions on this machine.

Actually hand-picked components for this build. Moved to a micro-ATX form factor case for its compromise on compact size and parts compatibility. In hindsight, I could've just moved components from the pre-built to a smaller case because it was still performing to my needs.

Kept getting strange static noise from the Focusrite Scarlette audio interface.

- Audio interface: Behringer UM2 2x2 audio interface

Cost of ink cartridges for all-in-one inkjet printers is ridiculous.

- Scanner: Epson Perfection V39 (4800 x 4800 DPI)  
- Printer: Brother HLL2350DW compact monochrome laser printer

Moved to an mini-ITX form factor case. Size restriction was interesting to work with. Pretty neat knowing how much power is packed into a small computer case that I can hold up with one hand.

Moved to smaller Silverstone SG13 mini-ITX case. Tried to use as many parts from previous build as possible.

### Peripherals

Some changes here and there. Previous Leopold keyboard went to the graveyard after an unfortunate accident with spilled coffee. Finally spent some money on a nice monitor. Wireless mice are fantastic.
