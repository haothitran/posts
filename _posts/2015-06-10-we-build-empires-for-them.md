Social media networks have turned our finite attention into a commodity. 

And we are continuously feeding them.

Our most precious currencies are *time* and *attention*. We have only so much time on this beautiful Earth and already have many other important things to care about. Our friends. Our families. Our taxes too, to be honest. And yet, we are spending those currencies by creating global social networks for companies.

And we do this work for free.

Social media networks are in a technological arms race against each other in trying to keep our eyeballs locked onto their site or app for as long as possible. The winners keep our gaze on them the longest, and even better if we spend our attention without question. Meanwhile, they constantly shove ads into our faces and glorify sensationalist news. Be shocked. Be afraid. Be up in arms about some conflict or event happening somewhere in the world.

And it has become exhausting to be passionate.

I can only imagine how much money these companies are putting into their research and design departments to engineer more effective ways to spend more of our time and attention on them.

And we let them.

We invite our friends and family members into these social networks and build a dependency as we tether each other together. We become more heavily anchored. With the promise of fostering better social connections, we give up our personal information and lure more people around us to them.

Hook, line, and sinker.

When does it stop?
