# We Build Empires for Them

Social media networks have turned our finite attention into a commodity amongst themselves. Our most precious currencies: time and attention, are being spent to create global social networks for companies.

And we are continuously feeding them.

Social media networks are in a technological arms race against each other in trying to keep our eyeballs locked onto their site or app for as long as possible. Winner keeps our gaze the longest, and even better if our attention is paid without question. Meanwhile, they are constantly shoving ads into our faces and glorifying sensationalist news stories. We should be shocked. We should be afraid. We should be up in arms about some conflict or event happening somewhere in the world. It has become exhausting to be passionate.

I can only imagine how much money these companies are putting into their research and design departments to engineer more effective ways for us to spend more of our time and attention on them.

And we let them.

We invite our friends and family members into these social networks, and build a dependency as we tether each other and become more heavily anchored to them. With the promise of fostering better social connections, we give up our personal information and lure more people around us to them.

Hook, line, and sinker.

When does it stop?
