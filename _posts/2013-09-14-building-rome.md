# Building Rome

Launching a brand new website, re-designing an existing one, or moving to a new platform is both exciting and daunting. Especially when you are the only one moving all the individual parts since you have no one to fall back on if you forget to implement a crucial detail.

Sometimes it is nice to work on a project that you are solely responsible for planning, designing, implementing, and executing. A little bit of a challenge. A little bit of learning involved. Keeps things interesting.

With no other stakeholders, I'm going to give myself leeway with time on working on this space to get everything exactly the way I want. Or, you know, possibly just use it as a reckless playground for testing web development and web design.
