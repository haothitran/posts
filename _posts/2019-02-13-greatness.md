When I was a child, my parents took me on a guided bus tour to see Ottawa, Montréal, and Québec City. I have to admit that I remember nothing remarkable about those few days, except that there were many museums, art galleries, and historical sites. Safe to say, I didn't have a good time. I just wanted to be back home in the comfort of my bedroom and watch weekend cartoons.

In hindsight, I believe my parents brought me along to be a mediocre English translator for them — I don't think I did a good job.

As my parents and I disembarked from the bus back in Toronto, the driver called out to us to wait a moment. We had barely interacted with the driver during our entire trip, so it was curious of him to single us out like that. But rather than speak to my parents, he took off his worn blue baseball cap and knelt on one knee in front of me. And in the middle of downtown pedestrian traffic, we studied each other for a long moment.

He then said something which has always perplexed me.

He said, "You're going to do something great one day."

I think about that a lot.
