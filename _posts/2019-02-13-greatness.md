When I was a child, my parents took me along on a bus tour to see Ottawa, Montréal, and Québec City. It wasn't an interesting tour for a kid—museums, art galleries, and historical sites. I wanted nothing more than to be comfortable at home. Honestly, it was such a bore that I don't remember anything remarkable about those few days.

At the end of the trip, as my parents and I disembarked from the bus, the driver called out to us. We barely interacted with the driver during our entire journey except exchanging common courtesies and inquiries after general health. It was curious for him to suddenly single us out like that.

Rather than speak to my parents, he knelt down in front of me on the pavement so that we were face-to-face. Then, he said something that has always perplexed me. He said, "You're going to do something great one day."

I think about that a lot.
