When I was a kid, my parents took me on a bus tour to see Ottawa, Montreal, and Québec City. It wasn't an interesting tour for a kid—museums, art galleries, tourists spots. I wanted nothing more than to be at home, but alas I was too young to be home alone. Honestly, I don't remember anything about those few days.

At the end of the trip, the driver, who I barely interacted with, told me, "You're going to do something great one day." He had called out to my parents and I to wait when we disembarked from the bus, and had kneeled down in front of me on the pavement to tell me this face-to-face.

I think about that a lot.
