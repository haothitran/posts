You never really know how much you can still improve until you surround yourself with more knowledgeable and skilled people. There will always be someone who knows more about something than you do, so everyone has the potential to be a conduit of knowledge for you.

In return, you teach them something too because you will always know something that they don't, no matter how large or small. That is the best thing about being around different people with their own unique experiences, talents, and interests.

Creating an atmosphere that fosters friendly competition and encouragement between its members pushes you to strive to learn and improve yourself. A positive feedback loop that you can immerse yourself in and grow.
