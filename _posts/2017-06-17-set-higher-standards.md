You never really know how much you can still improve until you surround yourself with more knowledgeable and skilled people. There will always be someone who knows more about something than you do, so everyone has the potential to be a conduit of knowledge for you.

In return, you will always know something that they don't, no matter how large or small. That is the best thing about being around people who have different experiences, skills, and interests.

Creating an atmosphere that fosters friendly competition and encouragement between its members pushes you to continuously strive to learn and improve yourself. This causes you to raise your personal standards which in turn raises other peopleâ€™s standards around you too. A feedback loop that can circle through different aspects of your life.
