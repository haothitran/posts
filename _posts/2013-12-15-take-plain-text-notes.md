I've realized that the traditional word processor is not the right tool to use when you just want to write. That is not to say that I don't think it is wrong to use a word processor. It is the right tool to use when creating documents with complex layouts, like resumes and pamphlets. For only taking notes, though? I think there are better alternatives.

For school, I have to consolidate a lot of information from different sources: lectures, textbooks, journal articles, newspapers, presentation slides, graphs, images, videos, and more. And I wanted to do this without having to resort to this nonsense:

```
school-notes/
├─┬ ABC101-course-name/
│ ├── 00-course-outline.doc
│ ├── 01-introduction.doc
│ ├── 01-introduction-lecture.ppt
│ ├── 02-basic-principles.doc
│ ├── 02-basic-principles-lecture.ppt
│ ├── 02-basic-principles-reading.pdf
│ └── ...
├── DEF202-another-course/
│ ├── 00-course-outline.pdf
│ ├── 01-introduction.doc
│ ├── 01-introduction-lecture.pdf
│ └── ...
└── ...
```

For several weeks, I took notes using a plain text editor while telling myself that I would continue looking for something better.  I didn't want to commit to using a word processor anymore. So, I fired up my operating system's default text editor and was ready to go within moments of entering a lecture hall. 

Eventually, I realized I had already found my replacement tool and used it all along without any trouble.

Plain text is a universal format in computing that does not rely on a specific set of tools or a particular platform to work. It is transferable and accessible. Using a file syncing service, I can create a new text file on my computer at home, then open and add notes to it on my tablet at school, and do the same with my phone on the subway. And when I'm back home and settled at my desk, I can see all the notes I've taken for the day in the same text file. How convenient. No matter what operating system or device I use, I can guarantee that I can open and edit plain text files anywhere at any time.

Also, since plain text files only contain raw text data, it is very stable and sustainable. It is one of the simplest file formats that continue to be relevant. Has it changed much since its conception? Nope. Ever heard of someone losing access to a plain text file? I haven't.

Of course, there are strict limitations. Most obvious is its inherent incapability to handle multimedia content. Usually, I can write a small description of an image or summarizing a video. When that doesn't work, I reference the file in my notes like `[see 01-video.mp4]` and save the files like this:

```
school-notes/
├─┬ SOC105-introduction-to-sociology
│ ├── 00-course-outline
│ ├── 01-introduction
│ ├── 02-development-of-sociology
│ ├── 02-development-of-sociology-01-video
│ ├── 03-schools-of-sociology
│ └── ...
└── ...
```

Another limitation is that there is no simple way to handle mathematical equations or tabular data. You can write basic equations, but anything more mathematically complex would be tedious and messy. Although, I think it is better to take handwritten notes for this type of subject material.

I think the lack of features in plain text is one of its greatest draws for me. I'm less distracted from my work. When writing essays, I sometimes procrastinate from writing by playing around with formatting the document, trying to convince myself that I am still technically working on my essay—no room for excuses like that when working within a plain text editor.

I have converted my personal reference notes to plain text too. I've dumped all my loose notes in a file named `_inbox.txt` so it stays at the top of the folder structure for quick access. Dated notes use the international date format to keep chronological ordering: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.txt` Titles are descriptive as possible so that there is never any question to what is in each text file. So far, this system has worked out well.

It shows that sometimes the best tool for the job might be an old one that has stood the test of time.
