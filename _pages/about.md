Located in Toronto, ON. Recently graduated with a BA in Sociology from Ryerson University.

I'm interested in how the intersections of technology, productivity, and systems work together. I enjoy tinkering around with software, like creating mini-websites with specific purposes. I like to think of myself as an audiophile, but I'm really not. And I believe that details make all the difference.

In case you were wondering, this site is:

- Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
