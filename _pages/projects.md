# Projects 

A list of personal projects. Most of these are small digital playgrounds that I created for a specific purpose that I revisit once in a while, usually to update the code to new expected standards or to experiment with new techniques. Includes projects that are no longer active.

- [Klazerville](https:://klazerville.com/) — a reference guide for various aspects of FFXIV

- [Pixel Perfect](https://github.com/haothitran/pixel-perfect) — displays current browser size in pixels
- [Launch](https://github.com/haothitran/launch) — a terminal-like startpage that supports commands
- [Reckless Ambition](https://reckless-ambition.com/) — landing page for a World of Warcraft guild
