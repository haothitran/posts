# Projects 

A list of personal projects. Most of these are small digital playgrounds that I created for a specific purpose that I revisit once in a while, usually to update code to keep up with new expected standards or to experiment with new available techniques. Includes projects that are no longer active.

## Klazerville

A reference guide for various aspects of Final Fantasy XIV. 

I created this site out of frustration with existing FFXIV online resources. Some had too much fluff text when all I wanted was a quick summary of boss fight encounters. Some did not enough information for doing certain things in-game. And others had such terrible writing that I could not make heads or tails of what the writer was trying to convey even after re-reading the same paragraph for several minutes. 

So, I decided to solve this issue by making my own FFXIV reference guide. It is a huge project to undertake, especially since existing content can change drastically with future patches or expansions, so this project will always be a work in progress. 

Currently, this site is powered by [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) until I find a better alternative. 

All content is personally verified by my in-game experiences.

## Reckless Ambition

A landing page for a progressive World of Warcraft raiding guild on Area-52 (US) server. I used to raid with this team during the latter half of Legion and periodically throughout Battle for Azeroth expansions. This site is not frequently updated.
