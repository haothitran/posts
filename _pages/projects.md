I created most of these projects for a specific purpose. Once in a while, I revisit them to update code to keep up with new expected standards or experiment with newly available techniques. Includes projects that are no longer active.

## Klazerville

A personal reference guide for [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/).

I created this website out of frustration with existing FFXIV online resources. There have either too much fluff text for boss fight encounters or not enough information for important mechanics. Sometimes the writing was awful, and I could not make sense of what the writer was trying to convey even after re-reading the same paragraphs.

I decided to resolve this issue by making my own FFXIV reference guide using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). This project will always be a work in progress due to the nature of FFXIV being an online game with future updates.

All content is personally verified by my in-game experiences.
