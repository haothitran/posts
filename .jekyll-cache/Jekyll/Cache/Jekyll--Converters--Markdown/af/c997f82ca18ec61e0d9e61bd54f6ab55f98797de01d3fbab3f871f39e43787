I"–<p>Life gets busy sometimes. However, I think that a lot of people are under the illusion that they are busy. Rather, in fact, people feel busy because they are constantly overwhelmed.</p>

<p>We live in a modern world where we have privileges and freedoms that weâ€™ve never had before. Our quality of life has greatly increased from just the past couple decades; a short span of time in relation to the entirety of our human existence. However, those things come at a cost because every choice requires a decision to be made, and every decision requires our focus. Unfortunately, focus is not something we have in abundance anymore.</p>

<p>There is always something to do. There is always something to see. There is always people to meet. There is always something to catch up on.</p>

<p>We have so many opportunities and options available to us, and we always need to make a decision about what to act on or what not to act on. We only have so much time and energy we have to spend. And all these little decisions we have to make add up. Inevitably, decision fatigue sets in and we start to avoid making those decisions that dictate our lives. Rather than deal with things, we keep jamming them into the back of our mental pantry until there is no more room causing us to make quick, uninformed choices we wouldâ€™ve otherwise not have made.</p>

<p>We need mental room to reflect. To make space to breathe. Set limits because if we donâ€™t set boundaries for ourselves, others will set them for usâ€”and we may not like where they draw the line. We canâ€™t burden ourselves with unnecessary responsibilities, choices, and things. We canâ€™t do everything, or have everything.</p>
