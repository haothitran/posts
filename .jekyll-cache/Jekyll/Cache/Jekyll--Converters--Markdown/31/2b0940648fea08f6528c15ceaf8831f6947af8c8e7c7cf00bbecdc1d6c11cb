I"Ñ<p>Sometimes working harder is not the solution. Sometimes there is a systematic problem that needs to be addressed. It may be caused by multiple interconnected issues, or it may originate from one source that is anchored deep in the system. In either case, something needs to change in the overall structure for things to improve. It is not always your fault. Some things are just out of your immediate control. And sometimes you canâ€™t do anything about it.</p>
