I"Ì<p>A few weeks ago, I came across this lightweight markup language called <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. It is a syntax used on plain text to indicate various kinds of formatting you want to apply when it is converted into another format.</p>

<p>I like that you can signify formatting for plain text without leaving the keyboard. It has a small learning curve; you only need to learn where to put asterisks (<code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code>), dashes (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>), backticks (<code class="highlighter-rouge">`</code>), and pound signs (<code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>) to format text. For example, you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">*single asterisks*</code> surrounding text to <em>emphasize</em> it. Keeps notes simple to write and easy to read.</p>

<p>Markdown still has many of the same limitations as plain text. However, it provides a way to create simple tables. Here is an example of a table using Markdown syntax:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| Level | Talent 1          | Talent 2           | Talent 3          |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 56    | Rolling Blood     | Plague Leech       | Unholy Blight     |
| 57    | Lichborne         | Anti-Magic Zone    | Purgatory         |
| 58    | Death's Advance   | Chillblains        | Asphyxiate        |
| 60    | Death Pact        | Death Siphon       | Conversion        |
| 75    | Blood Tap         | Runic Empowerment  | Runic Corruption  |
| 90    | Gorefiend's Grasp | Remorseless Winter | Desecrated Ground |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it will output a table like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Level</th>
      <th>Talent 1</th>
      <th>Talent 2</th>
      <th>Talent 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>56</td>
      <td>Rolling Blood</td>
      <td>Plague Leech</td>
      <td>Unholy Blight</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>57</td>
      <td>Lichborne</td>
      <td>Anti-Magic Zone</td>
      <td>Purgatory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>58</td>
      <td>Deathâ€™s Advance</td>
      <td>Chillblains</td>
      <td>Asphyxiate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>60</td>
      <td>Death Pact</td>
      <td>Death Siphon</td>
      <td>Conversion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>75</td>
      <td>Blood Tap</td>
      <td>Runic Empowerment</td>
      <td>Runic Corruption</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>90</td>
      <td>Gorefiendâ€™s Grasp</td>
      <td>Remorseless Winter</td>
      <td>Desecrated Ground</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For the past few months, Iâ€™ve been using plain text notes. However, Iâ€™ve been looking for a way to logically break up my notes in sectionsâ€”it is difficult to read walls of text. Iâ€™d attempted to create my own syntax to structure my content, but could never fully commit to a method. Discovering Markdown couldnâ€™t have come at a better time for me.</p>

<p>It was easy to incorporate Markdown into my existing workflow. I can still completely focus on my content rather than on formatting tools because I am still technically working in plain text. It just has a little bit of markup added to it.</p>
