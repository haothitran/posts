I"x	<p>Over the last year, I’ve rediscovered the vast world of podcasts and how well they fit into my lifestyle. Rediscovering meaning that I’ve discovered how much easier it is to listen to podcasts now compared to just even a few years ago. Smartphones and podcast apps have made it easy to subscribe, download, and keep up with shows.</p>

<p>I’ve become quite an avid listener due to my commutes to and from school. Some of the shows I listen to are of the educational variety which is funny because that means I basically spend my entire day out learning something new. Other shows are just for the pure entertainment value I get out of them.</p>

<p>On that note, here are some podcasts that I listen to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/">Hello Internet</a> by CGP Grey and Dr. Brady Haran.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortext</a> hosted by CGP Grey and Myke Hurley.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/">Lore</a> by Aaron Mahnke.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/penaddict">The Pen Addict</a> hosted by Myke Hurley and Brad Dowdy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/rd">Reconcilable Differences</a> by John Siracusa and Merlin Mann.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot of activities that only require the attention of my eyes and hands which leaves my ears free to wonder. Podcasts fit well into these pockets of time. I can listen to an episode or two when I am doing something mindless and repetitive, like everyday chores, grinding in Diablo III’s rifts, or dungeon crawling in the Darkest Dungeon. Anything that does not require a lot of attention or concentration is potentially a great time to be listening to a podcast.</p>

<p>It is an appealing form of entertainment for me. I enjoy being a silent participant in a number of different conversations relating to my personal interests. When show hosts go on tangents, I can tune it out for a moment, or skip an entire conversation thread all together. In extreme cases, I can just drop a podcast if the direction of the show no longer interests me.</p>

<p>I admit that it took me a while to get back into listening to podcasts. I think they are difficult to get into by yourself because there are so many shows about everything under the sun. It is overwhelming and intimidating to dive into them alone without guidance.</p>

<p>You just have to take a leap somewhere and start listening.</p>
