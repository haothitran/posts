I"ž<p>Located in Toronto, ON. Recently graduated with a BA in Sociology from Ryerson University.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in how the intersections of technology, productivity, and systems work together. I enjoy tinkering around with software, like creating mini-websites with specific purposes. I like to think of myself as an audiophile, but Iâ€™m really not. And I believe that details make all the difference.</p>
