I"$<p>I took a train to Montreal to visit a friend. Nice way to travel.</p>

<p>We enjoyed a few afternoon drinks at a bar. Watching people pass by the open windows while we tried to soothe the oppressive heat with icy cold drinks, but which just created a warm blaze in our chests. Later, we danced into the early morning hours at the hottest night club looking classy in the VIP section. We passed out after having terrible pizza from the parlour next door.</p>

<p>In the morning, we had a late brunch where we barely touched our food. In hindsight, we probably should have just shared a fruit platter because we couldn’t handle anything heavier in our stomachs. After a nap, we enjoyed sorbets under the late afternoon sun before I had to catch another train back to Toronto.</p>

<p>It was a good time.</p>

<p>Remarkably, it was my first time meeting my friend in person.</p>

<p>It is amazing how we can forge connections through the Internet without geolocation being a barrier to social interaction. As disruptive and pervasive as it is, the Internet has provided social opportunities that people decades ago can only ever imagine. It has allowed me to play online video games, where I met my friend, and forge a friendship that would not have been possible otherwise.</p>

<p>Just something I was thinking about as I was watching the sunset cross the moving landscape outside of my window. I always forget how breathtaking the sky is outside the glamour of city lights and bright billboards. It is late evening now—soon to be midnight.</p>

<p>Almost home.</p>
